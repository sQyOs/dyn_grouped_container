If you want to do code changes to the extension follow these simple steps to get going.

1. Get Qlik Sense Desktop
2. Create a new app and add advanced-kpi to a sheet.
3. Clone the repository
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run build` - to build a dev-version to the /dist folder.
6. Move the content of the /dist folder to the extension directory. Usually in `C:/Users/<user>/Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions/grouped-container`.
